# servicenow/no-proxy

`Proxy` is unsupported in Compatibility and ES5 Standards mode.

- **Family:** engine
- **Preset:** classic-es5
- **Placements:** classic-es5 (error)
- **Default severity:** error
- **Fix safety:** diagnostic only
- **Suggestions:** no
- **Authoring:** classic
- **Surfaces:** Applies to server, business-rule, script-include, ui-action, scheduled-script, fix-script when those surfaces are known. UI Actions require an explicit server surface; mixed client/server UI Actions stay silent because execution regions are not classified. An explicit javascriptMode also enables documented engine checks in otherwise unclassified files.
- **JavaScript mode:** Runs when javascriptMode is compatibility, es5. Unknown mode stays silent.
- **Last verified:** 2026-08-22
- **Implementation:** [`src/rules/no-proxy.ts`](../../src/rules/no-proxy.ts)
