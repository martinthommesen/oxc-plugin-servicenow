# servicenow/validate-glideaggregate-calls

A proven GlideAggregate must call `query()` before `next()` or `getAggregate()`. Static `getAggregate(type, field?)` must match a registered `addAggregate` tuple.

- **Family:** classic

- **Placements:** recommended (error), business-rule (error)
- **Default severity:** error
- **Fix safety:** diagnostic only
- **Suggestions:** no
- **Authoring:** classic
- **Surfaces:** Classic instance scripts. Client-only rules skip server-only files. Fluent files are skipped.

| _(none)_ | | | This rule has no options. |

## Incorrect

### Incorrect: next before query

```js
var count = new GlideAggregate("incident");
count.addAggregate("COUNT");
if (count.next()) {
  gs.info(count.getAggregate("COUNT"));
}
```

## Correct

### Correct: query then next

```js
var count = new GlideAggregate("incident");
count.addAggregate("COUNT");
count.query();
if (count.next()) {
  gs.info(count.getAggregate("COUNT"));
}
```

## Limitations

When provenance, surface, or JavaScript mode is unknown, the rule stays silent instead of guessing.

## Evidence

- None recorded. Add an authoritative ServiceNow or Oxc link before expanding this rule.
