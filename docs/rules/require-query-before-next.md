# servicenow/require-query-before-next

Require a proven GlideRecord binding to call `.query()` or `.get()` before `.next()`. `chooseWindow()` does not execute a query. Ambiguous branches are silent.

## Limitations

When provenance, surface, or JavaScript mode is unknown, the rule stays silent instead of guessing.
